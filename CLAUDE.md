### Recent Progress (Latest Session)

**‚úÖ Major Breakthroughs:**
1. **Fixed AI pathfinding failures** - Corrected invalid objective coordinates and map boundary validation
2. **Restored advanced AI capabilities** - Added USS Wasp ops, special abilities, logistics, objectives after git revert
3. **Eliminated duplicate actions** - Fixed AI generating multiple actions for same unit per turn
4. **Achieved unit positioning for combat** - AI successfully moves units to adjacent hexes (0 distance)
5. **Fun-focused priority system** - Implemented aggressive AI that prioritizes action over preservation

**üéØ Combat Test Results:**
- Units successfully positioned at 0 hex distance (same location)
- AI demonstrates tactical movement and positioning
- Both assault and defender AI generating decisions consistently
- Units maintain full health (3/3 HP) indicating no damage exchange

### Critical Issues Identified

**‚ùå Combat Execution Gap:**
1. **AI generates combat decisions but no attacks execute** - Units at 0 distance don't fight
2. **Special abilities prioritized over direct combat** - AI tries abilities instead of attacking adjacent enemies
3. **Missing combat priority recognition** - AI doesn't detect adjacent units as immediate combat opportunities
4. **Action phase vs decision phase mismatch** - Combat decisions generated but not converted to attack actions

**‚ùå Pathfinding & Map Issues:**
1. **Defender AI pathfinding still fails** - "No valid path to target" for complex terrain
2. **Water terrain blocking** - "Ground units cannot enter deep water" errors
3. **Map layout complexity** - Full battle series uses terrain that breaks simple pathfinding
4. **Target generation beyond map bounds** - AI generates coordinates outside valid map area

### Next Development Priorities

1. **CRITICAL: Fix combat execution** - Ensure adjacent units actually attack each other
2. **Combat priority tuning** - Make attack decisions override special abilities when in range  
3. **Map-aware pathfinding** - Generate targets based on actual map terrain and boundaries
4. **Defender AI positioning** - Fix pathfinding for defensive units to enable counter-attacks
5. **Full battle testing** - Run 10-game series once combat execution works

### Testing Framework Status

**Working Tests:**
- ‚úÖ `quick-battle-test.js` - 3-unit battles with successful positioning
- ‚úÖ `combat-test.js` - 1v1 controlled environment proving units reach combat range
- ‚úÖ `test-ai-system-gaps.js` - Comprehensive AI subsystem validation

**Problematic Tests:**
- ‚ùå `test-ai-battle-series.js` - 10-game series gets stuck in pathfinding loops
- ‚ùå Complex terrain maps expose pathfinding limitations
