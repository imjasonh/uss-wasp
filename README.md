# USS Wasp: Operation Beachhead Inferno

A TypeScript-based tabletop wargame simulation featuring asymmetrical amphibious assault gameplay.

## Overview

This project implements the "Operation: Beachhead Inferno" wargame as described in the rules documentation. The game features:

- **Assault Force**: USS Wasp LHD-1 with aircraft, landing craft, and Marine units
- **Defender Force**: Ground-based units with hidden deployment and fortifications
- **Hex-based gameplay** with turn-based mechanics
- **Simulation engine** for automated balance testing
- **Web-based interface** for human players

## Development Phases

This project follows a 6-phase development plan:

- **Phase 0**: âœ… Planning & Setup (hex grid, project structure)
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Core Simulation Engine (headless game logic)
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Basic Playable Interface (visual representation)
- **Phase 3**: âœ… Core Game Rules & Interaction (full manual playthrough)
- **Phase 4**: âœ… Hidden Units & Advanced Mechanics (fog of war, stealth)
- **Phase 5**: âœ… USS Wasp Operations & Logistics (amphibious assault, aircraft)
- **Phase 6**: ðŸš§ Advanced AI Implementation (multi-layered AI opponent)

### Current Status: Phase 6 - Advanced AI Implementation

**Completed AI Systems:**
- âœ… Core AI decision-making framework with threat assessment
- âœ… Multi-difficulty AI (Novice, Veteran, Elite, Adaptive)
- âœ… USS Wasp launch/recovery operations AI
- âœ… Hidden unit tactical AI (reveal/hide decisions)
- âœ… Special ability usage AI (artillery, reconnaissance, etc.)
- âœ… Objective-focused strategic planning AI
- âœ… Transport/logistics operations AI
- âœ… AI learning and adaptation system

**AI Testing Results:**
- 6/6 AI subsystems implemented (100% feature complete)
- Fun-focused AI prioritizing action over caution
- AI successfully positions units for combat (0 hex distance achieved)
- Comprehensive testing framework with multiple battle scenarios
- Advanced pathfinding and tactical movement systems

## Getting Started

### Simulation Engine (Console)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run AI vs AI gap analysis test  
node test-ai-system-gaps.js

# Run quick 3-unit battle tests (recommended)
node quick-battle-test.js

# Run 1v1 combat positioning test
node combat-test.js

# Run full 10-game battle series (experimental)
node test-ai-battle-series.js

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Web Interface
```bash
# Start web development server
npm run dev:web

# Build web version
npm run build:web
```

The web interface will be available at http://localhost:3000
