# USS Wasp (LHD-1) - Amphibious Assault Rules Engine

[![CI](https://github.com/imjasonh/uss-wasp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/imjasonh/uss-wasp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repo contains experimental [rules](./docs/rules.md) for a tabletop wargame on a hex grid, simulating an amphibious assault against entrenched defenders on land.

One side plays the attackers, deploying from a [USS Wasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(LHD-1)) amphibious assault ship with Marines, aircraft and landing craft.

The other side plays the defenders, deployed in hidden locations on land with surface-to-air missles and basic military units.

The repo contains a TypeScript-based rules engine and simulation framework for the game, in order to model the rules and hopefully achieve a balanced and fun gameplay experience.

### Key Classes

- **GameEngine**: Core rules processing and action resolution
- **GameState**: Game state management and player tracking
- **AIController**: AI decision making and tactical planning
- **Unit**: Individual unit behavior and capabilities
- **GameMap**: Hex grid terrain and objectives

## Game Rules

### Turn Structure
1. **Event Phase**: Random events and fog of war updates
2. **Command Phase**: Generate command points
3. **Deployment Phase**: Launch units and place hidden forces
4. **Movement Phase**: Unit movement actions
5. **Action Phase**: Combat, special abilities, objective control
6. **End Phase**: Victory checks and cleanup

### Unit Categories
- **Aircraft**: Harrier, Osprey (air superiority, transport)
- **Helicopters**: Super Stallion, Super Cobra (transport, attack)
- **Landing Craft**: LCAC, LCU (amphibious assault)
- **Ground Units**: Marines, MARSOC, Infantry (assault, defense)
- **Vehicles**: Humvee, AAV-7, Technical (transport, support)
- **Special Units**: USS Wasp, Artillery, ATGM teams

### Victory Conditions
- **Elimination**: Destroy all enemy units
- **USS Wasp**: Sink the USS Wasp (defender victory)
- **Objectives**: Control key terrain features
- **Turn Limit**: Highest score after maximum turns

## AI System

### Decision Making
The AI uses a utility-based system with tactical priorities:

1. **Threat Assessment**: Evaluate unit vulnerabilities
2. **Tactical Planning**: Generate context-aware decisions
3. **Action Execution**: Convert decisions to game actions
4. **Learning**: Track performance for adaptation

### AI Subsystems
- **USS Wasp Operations**: Launch/recovery planning
- **Hidden Unit Tactics**: Ambush and stealth operations
- **Special Abilities**: Artillery, air support, reconnaissance
- **Objective Control**: Strategic point capture
- **Transport Logistics**: Cargo management and deployment

## Balance Testing

### Test Categories
- **Standard Balance**: Basic win rate analysis
- **AI Difficulty**: Performance across skill levels
- **Game Length**: Turn count and resolution speed
- **Unit Effectiveness**: Individual unit performance

### Metrics
- Win rates by faction
- Average game length
- Unit survival rates
- Objective control patterns
- AI decision quality

### Running Balance Tests
