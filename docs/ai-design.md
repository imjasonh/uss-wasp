# AI Opponent Design Document
## USS Wasp: Operation Beachhead Inferno

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for sophisticated AI opponents in the USS Wasp amphibious assault wargame. Based on extensive research into asymmetric warfare simulation, modern game AI patterns, and military tactical doctrine, this system creates engaging AI opponents that effectively use guerrilla tactics, hidden unit deployment, and territorial defense against superior assault forces.

## Core Design Philosophy

- **Information Asymmetry**: Defender AI has superior local knowledge and intelligence
- **Force Multiplication**: Fewer units compensated by tactical advantages
- **Adaptive Strategy**: AI learns player patterns and adjusts tactics accordingly
- **Authentic Military Doctrine**: Based on real counterinsurgency and territorial defense strategies

### Player Experience Goals
1. **Challenging but Fair**: AI provides tough opposition without cheating
2. **Varied Gameplay**: Different strategies across multiple playthroughs
3. **Authentic Feel**: Tactics that mirror real asymmetric warfare
4. **Scalable Difficulty**: Progressive challenge levels for all skill ranges

## Hidden Unit Management System

### Detection and Concealment Model

#### Fuzzy Detection System
Rather than binary hidden/revealed states, units exist on a detection spectrum:

```
Detection Levels:
0 - Completely Hidden (no player awareness)
1 - Suspicious Activity (player notices something odd)
2 - Unit Detected (player knows something is there)
3 - Unit Identified (player knows unit type and rough position)
4 - Fully Revealed (exact position and capabilities known)
```

#### Detection Factors
- **Range**: Closer units easier to detect
- **Movement**: Moving units more detectable
- **Terrain**: Cover reduces detection
- **Player Actions**: Reconnaissance increases detection chance
- **Time**: Longer observation increases detection

### AI Hidden Unit Strategy

#### Optimal Reveal Timing
```typescript
interface RevealDecision {
  tacticalValue: number;    // Immediate combat advantage
  strategicValue: number;   // Long-term positional value
  riskAssessment: number;   // Chance of unit survival
  opportunityCost: number;  // Value of remaining hidden
}
```

**Reveal Triggers:**
1. **High-Value Targets**: Player units isolated or vulnerable
2. **Tactical Opportunity**: Player forced into disadvantageous position
3. **Strategic Necessity**: Objective under immediate threat
4. **Coordinated Attack**: Multiple units revealing simultaneously
5. **Desperation**: No other options available

#### Hidden Unit Roles

**Observers**: 
- Provide intelligence on player movements
- Remain hidden unless discovered
- Call in support from other units

**Ambush Units**:
- Positioned along likely player routes
- Wait for optimal engagement opportunities
- Strike and attempt to re-hide if possible

**Reaction Forces**:
- Hidden reserves for counterattacks
- Respond to player breakthroughs
- Support units under pressure

**Denial Forces**:
- Positioned on critical objectives
- Last line of defense
- Reveal only when objectives threatened

## Terrain Utilization Strategy

### Defensive Value Calculation

Each hex receives a defensive value based on:
```typescript
interface TerrainValue {
  coverBonus: number;        // Combat defensive modifier
  concealment: number;       // Hidden unit detection difficulty
  observationRange: number;  // Vision and firing range
  escapeRoutes: number;      // Available withdrawal paths
  supply: number;           // Ammunition and reinforcement access
  strategicValue: number;   // Objective importance
}
```

### Positioning Algorithms

#### High Ground Preference
- **Line of Sight**: Maximize observation range
- **Fire Superiority**: Enhanced attack ranges and effectiveness
- **Psychological Impact**: Forces player to attack uphill
- **Escape Routes**: Multiple withdrawal directions

#### Chokepoint Control
- **Force Concentration**: Channel player into narrow approaches
- **Overlapping Fire**: Multiple units covering same approach
- **Fallback Positions**: Prepared secondary positions
- **Obstacle Integration**: Use terrain to slow player advance

#### Urban Combat Tactics
- **Building-to-Building**: Use structures for cover and concealment
- **Ambush Points**: Position units at street corners and windows
- **Vertical Advantage**: Use multi-story buildings for observation
- **Escape Tunnels**: Underground movement between positions

## Resource Management AI

### Supply Constraint Modeling

#### Ammunition Management
```typescript
interface AmmoStrategy {
  conserveFirepower: boolean;     // Save ammo for critical moments
  targetPriority: UnitType[];     // Which units to engage first
  engagementRange: number;        // Optimal firing distance
  withdrawalTrigger: number;      // Ammo level to disengage
}
```

#### Force Preservation
- **Avoid Attrition**: Never fight fair engagements
- **Casualty Exchange**: Maximize player losses vs AI losses
- **Unit Value**: Protect high-value units (leaders, specialists)
- **Withdrawal Timing**: Know when to retreat vs fight

### Economic AI Decisions

#### Command Point Allocation
1. **Unit Activation**: Prioritize critical defensive actions
2. **Special Abilities**: Use when they provide maximum advantage
3. **Reinforcements**: Save points for emergency response
4. **Intelligence**: Invest in reconnaissance and detection

#### Supply Line Protection
- **Cache Defense**: Protect hidden supply points
- **Route Security**: Monitor player threats to supply lines
- **Adaptive Logistics**: Reroute supplies around player advances
- **Emergency Reserves**: Maintain strategic reserve supplies

## Combat AI Implementation

### Engagement Decision Matrix

```typescript
interface EngagementAnalysis {
  friendlyAdvantage: number;    // Local force ratio
  terrainAdvantage: number;     // Defensive modifiers
  supplyStatus: number;         // Ammunition availability
  escapeOptions: number;        // Withdrawal possibilities
  strategicValue: number;       // Importance of position
  playerVulnerability: number;  // Enemy disadvantages
}
```

### Tactical Combat AI

#### Target Selection Algorithm
1. **Threat Assessment**: Prioritize units that threaten objectives
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Target isolated or damaged units
3. **Force Multiplication**: Focus fire to eliminate units quickly
4. **Psychological Impact**: Target leaders and special units

#### Engagement Range Optimization
- **Optimal Distance**: Engage at maximum effective range
- **Ambush Range**: Close-range surprise attacks
- **Harassment Range**: Long-range fire to slow advance
- **Withdrawal Range**: Disengage before taking casualties

#### Coordinated Attacks
- **Synchronized Fire**: Multiple units engaging simultaneously
- **Flanking Maneuvers**: Attack from multiple directions
- **Supporting Fire**: Suppress while others maneuver
- **Diversionary Attacks**: Draw attention from main effort

## Learning and Adaptation System

### Player Behavior Analysis

#### Pattern Recognition
```typescript
interface PlayerPattern {
  landingPreferences: HexCoordinate[];   // Favorite landing zones
  movementTendencies: string[];          // Tactical preferences
  targetPriorities: UnitType[];          // Which units attacked first
  riskTolerance: number;                 // Aggressive vs cautious
  adaptationRate: number;                // How quickly they adjust
}
```

#### Adaptive Counter-Strategies
- **Landing Zone Prediction**: Pre-position units at likely LZs
- **Route Interdiction**: Place ambushes on preferred paths
- **Counter-Tactics**: Adapt to player's tactical preferences
- **Psychological Pressure**: Exploit player's risk aversion
