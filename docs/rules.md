- Fortification Markers ("Bunker," "Minefield," "Trench," "Barricade")
- Wasp Status Track Markers (for HP, Flight Deck, Well Deck, C2)
- Turn Counter

### Other Components
- **Dice:** D6 (several, for combat)
- **Player Aids:** Unit Data Cards, Terrain MPC Chart, Wasp Status Board, Command Point Tracker

## 2. Game Setup

### Map Assembly
- Players jointly select 6 unique map sections.
- Each player takes turns placing and orienting one map section until all 6 are placed. Sections must be placed adjacent to at least one other section. This creates a new battlefield each game.
- **Identify the Offshore Zone:** All hexes along one long edge of the assembled map. This is where the USS Wasp begins.

### Scenario & Objectives
Draw 1-2 Scenario Cards. These define:

**Assault Primary Objectives:** (e.g., "Capture and Hold the Port for 2 turns," "Destroy the Enemy Comms Hub," "Extract VIP from Civic Center").

**Assault Secondary Objectives:** (e.g., "Eliminate all enemy AA units," "Secure the Airfield").

**Defender Primary Objectives:** (e.g., "Prevent capture of Port for 15 turns," "Eliminate >50% of Assault units," "Destroy the USS Wasp").

**Defender Secondary Objectives:** (e.g., "Disable 2+ Assault aircraft," "Hold the High Ground").

Place Objective Markers on their designated hexes according to the Scenario Card.

### Force Selection (Pre-Game "Points Buy" - Optional Advanced Rule)

**Standard Game (Recommended First Play):** Use pre-determined force lists provided for each side (e.g., all units listed under "Game Components").

**Advanced Game (Points Buy):** Each player is given a Force Selection Budget (e.g., 300 points for Assault, 250 points for Defender). Players choose units from their available pool, each unit having a Point Cost. This allows for strategic customization. The Wasp itself and its base crew are "free."

### Defender Deployment
- The Defender secretly places their units.
- All Defender Infantry Squads, ATGM Teams, AA Teams, Mortar Teams, Technicals, and Militia Squads must be placed as Hidden Unit Markers.
- Defender may also place up to 5 Dummy Hidden Unit Markers anywhere within their deployment zones.
- Defender can spend a portion of their initial force selection points (or a predetermined amount) to place Fortification Markers (Bunker, Minefield, Trench, Barricade). These are placed openly.
- The Long-Range Artillery/SAM Battery is considered off-board but can be activated through Command Points.
- **Deployment Zones:** Defender units must be placed within 5 hexes of any objective marker, OR within their designated defensive zones (e.g., "South Sector," "North Ridge").

### Assault Force Initial Placement
- The USS Wasp miniature is placed in any hex within the Offshore Zone.
- All Assault Force aircraft, landing craft, and ground units begin either on the USS Wasp or within the Offshore Zone (representing units awaiting deployment). None can start on land hexes initially.

### Initial Status
- Set the Turn Counter to 1.
- Set Wasp Status Track Markers to "Operational."
- Each player gains their starting Command Points (CP) for Turn 1 (Wasp: 3 CP, Defender: 2 CP).

## 3. Unit Data Cards & Combat Rules

Each unit has a Unit Data Card with the following stats:

- **MV (Movement Allowance):** Max hexes unit can move.
- **ATK (Attack Dice):** Number of D6 rolled when attacking.
- **DEF (Defense Value):** Target number for enemy attack rolls (lower is better for defense).
- **HP (Hit Points):** How much damage unit can take.
- **SP (Supply Points):** (Air/Vehicle units only) How many attacks/special actions before needing resupply.
- **Special Abilities:** Unique rules for the unit.

### Simplified Combat Resolution

1. **Declare Attack:** Attacker declares an attacking unit, its target, and confirms LOS.
2. **Roll ATK Dice:** Attacker rolls ATK dice.
3. **Apply Modifiers:**
   - **Terrain Cover:** Defender's unit in Light Cover (+1 DEF), Heavy Cover (+2 DEF).
   - **Flank Attack:** If attacker is adjacent to target's side/rear (defined by hex facing rules), +1 ATK die (or -1 DEF for target).
   - **Suppressed:** Attacking unit is Suppressed, -1 ATK die.
   - **Ambush Bonus (Defender Only):** If a Hidden Defender unit reveals and immediately attacks, +1 ATK die.
4. **Determine Hits:** For each die roll equal to or greater than the Defender's modified DEF value, it's a hit.
5. **Apply Damage:** Each hit removes 1 HP from the target.
   - If HP reaches 0, the unit is destroyed and removed from play.
   - If HP is reduced but not to 0, the unit receives 1 Suppression Token. If already Suppressed, it receives a second.
6. **Supply Consumption:** Attacking unit expends 1 SP if it has an SP track.

### Suppression
- A unit with 1 Suppression Token suffers -1 ATK and -1 MV on its next turn.
- A unit with 2 Suppression Tokens cannot move or attack on its next turn (it is Pinned).
- At the end of a unit's turn, if it did not attack, it can remove 1 Suppression Token.

## 4. Phases of a Turn (15 Turns Max)

Each game turn proceeds in the following order:

### A. Event Phase
- **Turn Counter Advance:** Advance the Turn Counter by 1.
- **Draw Event Card:** Draw one Event Card and resolve its effect. These can be environmental (e.g., "Heavy Fog: All LOS reduced by 2 hexes this turn"), tactical (e.g., "Local Uprising: Defender can place 1 Militia Squad in any Urban hex, revealed"), or logistical (e.g., "Wasp Hull Integrity Breach: USS Wasp takes 1 HP damage").

### B. Command Phase

**Generate Command Points (CP):**
- **Assault Force:** Gains 3 CP. (If USS Wasp C2 status is Degraded, gains 2 CP; if Offline, gains 0 CP).
- **Defender Force:** Gains 2 CP.

**Spend Command Points:** Players may now spend their accumulated CP.
- **Strategic Action Cards:** Players may play Strategic Action Cards from their hand (if using this optional rule) by paying the CP cost.
- **Special Abilities:** Pay CP to activate specific unit or faction abilities (e.g., Defender's "Call Artillery Strike," Assault's "Coordinated Air Support").
- **Reinforcements (Defender Only):** Defender may spend CP to deploy Reinforcement Units (e.g., 2CP for an additional Infantry Squad) at designated map edge entry points. These units are immediately revealed.
- **Rapid Deployment (Assault Only):** Assault may spend 1 CP to deploy an additional unit from the Wasp beyond normal limits (see Deployment Phase).
- **Forced March:** Spend 1 CP to allow a unit to move an additional 2 hexes (even exceeding MA).
- **Construction (Defender Only):** Spend 1-2 CP to place a temporary Barricade or Trench marker in an unoccupied hex adjacent to an unsuppressed infantry unit.

### C. Deployment Phase (Assault Force Only)
- **Wasp Flight Deck Launch:** The Wasp player can launch up to 2 aircraft units from the USS Wasp's Flight Deck. (If Flight Deck status is Limited, launch 1; if Damaged, launch 0).
- **Wasp Well Deck Launch:** The Wasp player can launch up to 1 LCAC OR 2 AAVs from the USS Wasp's Well Deck. (If Well Deck status is Limited, launch 1 AAV; if Damaged, launch 0).
- **Initial Movement:** Newly launched units are placed in the Offshore Zone adjacent to the USS Wasp and may immediately move up to their full MA.

### D. Movement Phase
**Order:** Assault Air Units -> Defender Ground Units -> Assault Ground & Amphibious Units.

- **Assault Air Unit Movement:** Assault player moves all their deployed Air Units (Harriers, Ospreys, Helos). (See Unit Movement Rules above).
- **Defender Ground Unit Movement:** Defender player moves all their Revealed Ground Units (Infantry, ATGM, AA, Technical, Mortar). (See Unit Movement Rules above).
- **Assault Ground & Amphibious Unit Movement:** Assault player moves all their deployed Ground Units (Marines, AAVs, Humvees) and Amphibious Units (LCACs, LCUs). (See Unit Movement Rules above).

### E. Action Phase
**Order:** Assault Force Actions -> Defender Force Actions. Players alternate activating one unit at a time.

- **Assault Force Actions:** The Assault player activates one of their deployed, unsuppressed units to perform one action (Attack, Load/Unload, Special Ability, Secure Objective). Repeat until all desired Assault units have acted, or none can act.
- **Defender Force Actions:** The Defender player activates one of their deployed, unsuppressed units to perform one action. This includes Hidden Units choosing to Reveal and then immediately taking an action (gaining Ambush Bonus if attacking). Repeat until all desired Defender units have acted, or none can act.

### F. End Phase
- **Check Victory Conditions:** Check if either player has met their Primary Victory Conditions. If so, the game ends.
- **Resupply:**
  - Assault Air Units and Vehicles that are on the USS Wasp (Flight Deck or Well Deck) or an Airfield hex (if secured by Assault) automatically replenish their SP to full.
  - Assault Ground Units in a Captured Port or Civic Center hex automatically resupply 1 SP if applicable.
- **Suppression Removal:** All units with 1 Suppression Token that did not attack this turn remove their token. Units with 2 Suppression Tokens remove one token.
- **Prepare for Next Turn:** All remaining CP are lost. Proceed to the next Event Phase or end the game.

## 6. Victory Conditions

The game ends immediately when any of the following conditions are met.

### Assault Force Victory
- **Primary Objective Fulfilled:** The Assault Force successfully achieves ALL their Primary Objectives listed on the Scenario Card (e.g., Captures the Port and holds it for 2 consecutive turns AND Destroys the Comms Hub).
- **Defender Collapse:** The Defender has no active units remaining on the board (all destroyed or Pinned beyond recovery).

### Defender Force Victory
- **Assault Force Stalled:** The Turn Counter reaches 15, and the Assault Force has NOT fulfilled all their Primary Objectives.
- **Wasp Disabled/Sunk:** The USS Wasp's Structural Integrity track reaches 0.
- **Assault Force Annihilation:** The Assault Force has fewer than 3 active units (ground, air, or amphibious) remaining on the board.

### Draw
If both players meet a victory condition simultaneously (e.g., on the same turn, the Assault achieves their objective, but the Wasp is also sunk), the game is a Draw.

### Game End & Scoring (for more complex scenarios)
If both players complete the game without a decisive victory, a scoring system can be used:

- **Primary Objective (Assault):** 10 VP each
- **Secondary Objective (Assault):** 5 VP each
- **Eliminating Enemy Unit (per point cost of unit):** VP equal to 50% of unit cost.
- **Holding Objectives (Defender):** 2 VP per objective held at game end.
- **Wasp HP Remaining (Assault):** 1 VP per HP remaining on Wasp (if Defender's goal wasn't to sink it).

Player with the higher VP total wins.
